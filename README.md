# Multiple_Linear_Regression
This project implements Multiple Linear Regression to analyze and predict a continuous target variable using two or more independent features.  Unlike single linear regression, multiple linear regression captures the combined effect of multiple predictors on the dependent variable, providing a more realistic and accurate model for real-world data.
